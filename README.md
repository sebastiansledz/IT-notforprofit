# List of IT resources for non-profit organizations

This repository was created to maintain a list of IT resources for non-profit organizations. I will try to focus on free resources, credits to use, discounts and any other kind of Internet things that might help organizations with their web being. Together with list there will be a growing set of reviews, articles and guides about how to use the resources. I have in mind that people that manage organizations are not tech savvy and they need help with many aspects that are straightforward for admins and developers. Have an idea to extend the list? PRs are wery welcome.
